# ggr6

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ggr6 is to provide a modern R implementation of Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics using the best available tools.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("paleolimbot/ggr6")
```
## Example

Currently, there are no exported functions or classes and the package is not functional. If you're curious, I suggest checking out the tests.
